# Alkindi - CES

**A tribute to the 9th century mathematician, father of cryptography, and Brute Force developer Alkindi.**

Alkindi is a crypto currency exchange software (CES). It came in development out of curiosity that how crypto exchanges work in real life.

The main focus is to develop a matching engine in the C++ lanugage for buyers and sellers of different currencies.

Matching engine looks at the order book and matches bids to asks.

I pulled a dataset, say Order Book, from an Open API for currency exchange using a Python script. So, technically my database is merely a CSV file for now.

**Warning:** This is not a trading platform. Do not use it for any kind of online crypto currency or CFD buy and sell.
